## Installation


To use the project, click this [link](https://weather-view-767i.onrender.com/).


## Usage


After clicking on the above link, let the wb application load.


NOTE: The application server sleeps when no activity is detected, so it will likely take up to a minute for the web page to load. Just be patient!


Once the webpage loads, you wil be presented with this screen.

Following the prompts, type the name of your city into the search bar and click "Search". The current weather will then display for your city in the main window and below it, five cards will display that show the 5 day forecast for that city. The cities you have searched will show on the left of the screen.

Items in that history can deleted by selecting the trash can button to the right of each name.

To search a different city, just type its name into the search bar. Cities you have already entered can be quickly searched by clicking on their name in the history queue.
